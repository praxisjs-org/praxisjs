# @praxisjs/decorators

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- f48dbc4: Introduce WithHistory<T, K> utility type for better TypeScript inference when using the @History decorator, and fix performance issues in the history() primitive.

  Changes:

  @praxisjs/decorators: Added WithHistory<T, K> type that maps a property key to its corresponding \*History accessor type, enabling proper type-checking on decorated classes.
  @praxisjs/decorators: Simplified @History decorator internals — replaced verbose getOwnPropertyDescriptor lookups with direct property access (this[propertyKey]), reducing complexity.
  @praxisjs/core: Fixed history() to use peek() when reading \_past and \_current inside the tracking effect, preventing unnecessary re-runs caused by reactive reads during history recording.
  @praxisjs/core: Added an \_initialized guard so the first value is captured without pushing an empty entry into the past stack.
